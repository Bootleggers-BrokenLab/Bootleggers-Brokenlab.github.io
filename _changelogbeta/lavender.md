Call this timing, a weekly update! Using an outdated version of sdm660 trees, fixed GCams and added the following features:
- Volume rocker to skip track
- Some changes to music info on ambient display (like pulsing on new song or even double tap to skip)
- Broke Xiaomi parts summary
- Added LS funnies: Album filter, toggles, and blur intensity switchable on all the 3 variants of gradients!
- Added LS visualizer with the ambient thing, because i missed it
- Maybe something else but i completely forgot
